This single page application displays a map of Chicago downtown, containing markers showing popular park and museum locations. It provides filter functionality, allowing users to switch between viewing all markers, parks or museums only. The search function narrows down displayed markers by allowing user to search by either full or partial attraction names. User could either use search OR filter option. Using either option clears out the other feature selection. The list feature displays chosen popular destinations, clicking on which would open up info window on the map,  display a short detail info from wiki, as well as a link to the corresponding article on the Wikipedia page.  For the smaller size devices (less than 900px), the search options menu would hide for 10 seconds, allowing for full view of the selected results.  User also has an option to show/hide search menu options by clicking on the menu icon above it.
In order to run the application, please download all the files maintaining the structure and open index.html page in Firefox.
